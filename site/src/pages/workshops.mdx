</Aside>

**To stay competitive, companies need to ship better web experiences faster than ever.**

The web is constantly evolving, and customers are demanding more and more from the web-based products they use. Companies need to be able to respond quickly to feedback, to deliver products and features faster than ever — while simultaneously creating higher quality experiences.

In this workshop, Jason Lengstorf will teach you how the software architecture known as **the Jamstack can put your team on the fast track to creating incredible web experiences in record time.** This practical, hands-on workshop will help teams and individual developers alike hit the ground running with the Jamstack.

This workshop will cover the technical foundations of the Jamstack, starting with the basics and ramping up to advanced concepts like **user dashboards protected with authentication**, building **dynamic experiences using client-side and serverless technology**, **reading from and writing to databases**, and more.
