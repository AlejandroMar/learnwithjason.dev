# How to Participate in Learn With Jason

At its core, _Learn With Jason_ is powered by the community. Live viewers are able to participate in episodes by chatting, playing sound effects, joining giveaways, and other interactive elements.

The show is always so much more fun when you show up to ask questions, tease Jason, offer up ideas, and help out with suggestions and information.
